### Suggest Features

New feature suggestions or UI improvements are always welcome.

This project is powered by open source volunteers, so we have a limited amount of development resource to address all requests. We will certainly make best efforts to progress (particularly for those with strong community upvotes).

### Code Contributions

If you plan to contribute, please create a Github issue (or comment on the relevant existing issue) so we can help coordinate with upcoming release plans.


### Design

There are some cosmetic issues we could use help with (designing images or UI). 

### Testing

There are a number of issues we could use help with reproducing.
